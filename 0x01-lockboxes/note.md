# Thought Process

1. **Understanding the Problem:** First, let's understand the problem statement. We have a series of locked boxes, each containing keys to other boxes. We need to determine if all the boxes can be opened.

2. **Plan of Action:** To solve this problem, we'll employ a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. DFS is a common approach for exploring graphs or networks, where we systematically traverse all possible paths.

3. **Initialize Data Structures:** We'll start by initializing some data structures:

- `visited`: A list to keep track of visited boxes.
- `stack`: A stack to store the boxes we need to explore.

4. **Begin Exploration:** We start the DFS from the first box, which is initially unlocked. So, we mark the first box as visited and add it to the stack.

5. **DFS Algorithm:**

- While the stack is not empty:
  - Pop a box from the stack.
  - Iterate through the keys in the current box:
    - If the key corresponds to a valid box (within the range of the list) and that box has not been visited:
      - Mark the box as visited.
      - Add the box to the stack for further exploration.

6. **Termination Condition:** The DFS continues until there are no more boxes to explore in the stack.

7. **Check Completion:** After DFS completes, we check if all boxes have been visited. If all boxes have been visited, return True; otherwise, return False.

8. **Implementation:** We implement the DFS algorithm in the canUnlockAll function.

9. **Testing:** We test the function with provided test cases to ensure correctness.

10. **Review and Optimization:** Finally, we review the implementation for correctness, readability, and efficiency. In this case, the implementation appears to be correct, so we can proceed without further optimization.
